== README

Basic shopping website with stock control.  Uses Amazon Web Services S3 for image uploads.

== Features

=== User

* Seller and buyer accounts
* Seller can list items, view orders, create stock, etc
* Buyer can only buy things

== Orders

* Orders start in +cart+ status and have a set of allowed flows

=== Products

* Create Products to sell from the Seller menu
* Nestable sub-products (for sizes, etc)
* Multiple images per product
* For sale? flag to say if the product should be listed

=== Stock levels

* Stock levels for each product (and sub product)
* Stock levels have a "due date" and "expiry date", as well as a pre-orderable flag
* When an +Order+ changes to status +paid+ it creates allocations from available stock and decrements stock level

=== Gift cards

* Create +GiftCardProduct+ s from the Seller menu to list available gift card denominations
* A user buying any +GiftCardProduct+ s will generate a +GiftCard+ and email them a link with a redemption code to pass on to the intended recipient
* If the +Order+ only has +GiftCardProduct+ s as +LineItem+ s then the order will automatically progress to +dispatched+ status when the email has been sent
